# Time Dilation Calculator (Incomplete)
*Is there a sweet spot with travel velocity in relation to time dilation?*

This project is the spawn of a fun idea I had while thinking about time dilation.

### What is this?

So far, this is an exploration and compilation of ideas relative to time dilation.

### What is the goal?

I'm not sure yet. This is a project I started for fun, and I eventually want to combine the elements
that have been created thus far. I was unable to find a calculator online that could answer the
questions that I had in a quick and easy fashion, so I created a couple of my own and even made some
interesting discoveries along the way!
